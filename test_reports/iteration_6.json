  "summary": "Completed frontend testing of the Marketplace form input performance fix. The bug (slow input due to re-renders on each character) has been fixed using useCallback for handlers and name attributes on inputs. All form fields (Title, Description, Price, Location) now respond quickly with ~30-40ms per character. Article creation, editing, and status changes all work correctly.",
